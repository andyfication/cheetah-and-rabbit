# cheetah-and-rabbit

## Introduction

> Created and prototyped in Processing at first and then extended using C++ and Openframeworks, Cheetah and Rabbit is an artificial intelligence program which simulates the Rabbit and Cheetah game. The interface allows users to choose among three options: a computer simulation and two mini-games where players get to play both animals in different scenarios. The first option recreates a chase between the two entities where players can randomly allocate their positions on the grid field. In the second option players take control of the rabbit with the aim of collecting food score and avoiding the cheetah. The final option is very close to a puzzle game; players have to figure out the rabbit's position and move the cheetah exactly to that location. Cheetah and Rabbit allowed deep understanding and research of data structures such as stacks and queues and analysis and implementation of Object-Oriented Programming.
